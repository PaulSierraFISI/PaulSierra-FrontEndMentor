## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- JS
- Responsively APP
- Mobile-first workflow
- Chat GPT (to solve questions)
- Js Events

### What I learned

I improved my skills using Tailwind. My knowledge about positioning with relative and absolute positioning attributes also got better. There were some attributes that I've never used, but I had to, and that was the best part of it. No doubt, I put in practice my css grid and flexbox skills once more.
