## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Display Grid

### What I learned

The most important tip that I learned here is:
To aplly display grid and to do the site responsive. 

### Continued development

In my future projects I'll be focused on the desings and save time in details. Maybe I can use a framework CSS like TailwindCSS.
Also I can study more about web responsive, specifically about images, because I was checking the site with Responsively App and in some resolutions the site doesn't look very well.
