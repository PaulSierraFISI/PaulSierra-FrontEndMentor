## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- JS
- Responsively APP
- Mobile-first workflow
- Chat GPT (to solve questions)

### What I learned

I improved my skills using Tailwind. My knowledge about positioning with relative and absolute positioning attributes also got better. There were some attributes that I've never used, but I had to, and that was the best part of it.
